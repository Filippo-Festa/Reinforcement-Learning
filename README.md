# Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a collection of exercises and projects developed for the Reinforcement Learning course at the **Universit√† degli Studi di Padova**. 

## Overview

The exercises in this repository cover a wide spectrum of reinforcement learning topics, offering a hands-on approach to understanding how agents learn to make decisions through interaction with their environment. The repository is structured to help students build a strong foundation in reinforcement learning, progressing from basic principles to more complex strategies and techniques.

## Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning:** Fundamental concepts including Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), reward functions, value functions, and policy optimization.

- **Dynamic Programming:** Implementation of value iteration and policy iteration algorithms for solving MDPs.

- **Model-Free Methods:** Exploration of temporal-difference (TD) learning, including algorithms like Q-learning and SARSA.

- **Policy Gradient Methods:** Understanding and implementation of policy gradient methods, including REINFORCE and Actor-Critic algorithms.

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning:** Introduction to deep RL with exercises on Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and other neural network-based approaches.

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Techniques for balancing exploration and exploitation in RL, such as epsilon-greedy strategies and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB).
